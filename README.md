- 👋 Hi, My name is Ty Sampson
- 👀 I am a self-taught programmer who's doing this just for fun; but also as a means to express my business ventures and creativity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML CSS and Python programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will broaden my knowledge and help me grow in this field. I am new to coding. I am an accountant since July 2009 and am ready to try something new.
